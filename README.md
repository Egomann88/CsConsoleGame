## Features need to be implemented / fixed:
- If the Character dies, it will be saved with 0 hp; Save file should be deleted
- If the Character renames himself, a new Save File will be generated
- If a Character has the EXACT same name as another, the Save File will OVERWRITE the of the other character
- Save Folder must be created if not exists
